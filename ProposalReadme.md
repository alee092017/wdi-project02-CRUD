1.  Basis of project:
    *  [GA Outcomes Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egFjc9N0jQ45Wzj2tj_8r2x7NVEiw9Oa0GvU80XSq0s/edit?usp=sharing)
    *   Basically turning this into an app
2.  Core functionality of project:
    * Have an Outcomes Toolbox that allows the user to:
      * Write a brand statement - why is this red?
      * Link to resume on creddle.io
      *  Link to github
      *  Link to LInkedin
      *  Website/Portfolio
      *   GA Profile
      *   Additional info like a blog?
      *   Each of above will have a status column with 3 options:
          *   Draft
          *   In Process
          *   Complete
          *   (or a 4th?  Revision?)
